## Only Connect 4

This is a two player game.

Both players take turns dropping coloured balls (blue or red) into columns.
                        
The dropped ball places itself in the last empty slot of that column.For example, the first dropped ball will be placed in the bottom row.

The first player to get 4 balls of the same color horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game. 

Blue begins the game.
